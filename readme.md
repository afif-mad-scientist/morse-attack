# Morse attack
Its a MATLAB script to attack a Morse code which has no separation between letters. so in order to find to secret word i've used an eliminatory method to extract all the possible combinations that can be readed by the morse code.
Now am searching how to find the exact word needed between all the nonsens words extracted.
